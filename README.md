# code-execution-node

Use Heroku Dynos as a Node.js code execution environment within your AI applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) can use this Heroku app to boot [one-off dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/one-off-dynos), install Node.js packages, and run Node.js code.

Best of all, the app is free to deploy and does not require actively running Dynos.
